## Features

- **Player Tracking**: Track individual players with high precision.
- **Team Separation**: Distinguish between players from different teams.
- **Camera Movement Tracking**: Monitor camera movements for enhanced analysis.
- **Distance and Speed Monitoring**: Calculate distance covered by players and their speed during movement.
- **Ball Tracking**: Accurately trace the movement of the ball.
- **Team Possession Analysis**: Analyze team possession based on player movements.
  
## Libraries Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Supervision
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- YOLO
  
## Installation
 Clone the repository:

     <bash>
   git clone https://github.com/chiragHimself/FootballAnalyserYolo.git 

## Folder Structure

- **models**: Contains YOLO model weights.
- **scripts**: Houses all the Python scripts.
- **output**: Stores the output generated by the system.

## Usage

1. Configure the system by modifying parameters in the scripts if needed.
2. Run the main script to start the detection and monitoring process.
3. View the output generated in the `output` folder.
