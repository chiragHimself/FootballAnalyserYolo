You can refer to the followng ipynb notebook and run it in your colab environment to train the model and store it in respective model folder.
You may change the Epochs or batch sizes if you are on computational budget , although it is suggested to train the similar model for similar results.
If you cannot train a separate model due to constraints , then you can use my pretrained and finetuned YOLOv model through given drive link by downloading it in your model folder.
